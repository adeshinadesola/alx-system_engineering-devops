API Advanced

This project focuses on advanced concepts of working with APIs, specifically the Reddit API. It aims to improve your skills in making API calls, parsing data, and presenting information.   

Background Context

API-related questions are commonly asked in interviews, ranging from simple tasks like querying an endpoint to more complex tasks involving recursion, data formatting, and sorting. The Reddit API provides an excellent platform for practice due to its numerous available endpoints and vast amount of information to be extracted and presented. Familiarity with API calls can be beneficial not only for technical interviews but also for personal use cases, making tasks more efficient and convenient.
