<h1>Webstack Monitoring</h1>
This project focuses on implementing a web stack monitoring tool to measure and monitor the performance of software systems running on servers. By understanding the concepts of monitoring and server management, this project aims to ensure that the servers are not overloaded and that the software is functioning as expected.

<h5>Application Monitoring: Gathering data about running software to ensure it functions correctly.
</h5>
<h5>Server Monitoring: Collecting data about virtual or physical servers to prevent overload issues such as CPU, memory, disk, or network overload.</h5>
